## Homebridge plugin for Prusa Link

This [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) plugin currently creates an motion sensor which will be triggered when the printer finishes a print. Also the sensor features a battery level which shows the current print progress in percent.

I myself use this to get a notification on my iPhone when my printer is ready.
